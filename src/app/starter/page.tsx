          How to make a Sourdough Starter?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Starting your Sourdough Starter is the beginning of an exciting
          adventure with delicious healthy homemade bread, pizza dough,
          flapjacks and so much more the list is endless. A Sourdough Starter is
          made from flour, water and the bacteria in the air around us. Instead
          of buying dry yeast, you will be making your own living yeast. I have
          found that bread and pizza dough made with a sourdough starter is
          easier for me to digest and the taste and texture is better.

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-3">What you will need:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>500g whole flour</li>
          <li>1 litre glass jar.</li>
          <li>Filtered water.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 1</h5>
        <p>
          Use a clean bowl to mix 25g water and 25g flour, cover it with a
          kitchen towel and leave it for 12 hours at room temperature. My
          kitchen&apos;s temperature averages between 20-23Â°C.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 2</h5>
        <p>
          Feed your starter with 25g flour and 25g water. Cover and leave at
          room temperature overnight.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 3</h5>
        <p>
          Discard 50g of the starter(there are a few recipes to try with your
          starter discard). In your glass jar mix 50g flour and 50g water to the
          remaining starter, cover and leave overnight.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 4</h5>
        <p>
          Discard 75g of the starter, feed your remaining starter 50g flour and
          50g water. Cover and leave overnight.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 5</h5>
        <p>
          Your starter should start developing small bubbles and have a
          pleasantly sour smell. Discard 100g of the starter, feed the remaining
          starter 75g flour and 75g water. Cover and leave overnight.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 6</h5>
        <p>
          The starter should appear full of bubbles with a slightly sour smell.
          Discard 125g of the starter, feed the remaining starter 100g flour and
          100g water. Cover and leave overnight.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold text-base mt-3">Day 7</h5>
        <p>
          Today you can start making your bread, your starter should be very
          active and full of bubbles. You want to use your starter when it
          reached its peak, this will help your bread to rise. If you are unsure
          if your starter is ready just add a teaspoon of starter to a bowl with
          cold water if it floats your starter is ready. Make sure when you use
          your starter you keep some starter to feed for your next sourdough
          bread. If your starter is not active yet just keep discarding and
          feeding for a few extra days.

          Maintaining your sourdough starter
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            When kept at room temperature you will need to feed your starter
            every day.I feed my starter 1:1:1 - If the weight of the starter is
            100g, I will feed 100g flour and 100g water. I like adding rye flour
            with my white bread flour when I feed my starter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having to feed your starter every day can become quite expensive.
            Therefore, you can store your starter in the fridge for up to 10
            days and taken out when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the starter out of the fridge the day before you plan to bake
            and feed it the night before. The next morning the starter should be
            active and full of bubbles and ready to bake with.
